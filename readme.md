## Numerical Methodology Algorithms
This is my take on solving all algorithms in C. I will be using dynamic memory allocation to write the algorithms as to make the code versatile to different inputs. This will also allow us to the declare the size of our matrix in runtime.[more](https://www.geekinterview.com/question_details/3407)
I will be contributing two algorithms per week in this repo.
