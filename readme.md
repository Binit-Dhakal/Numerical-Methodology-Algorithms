## Numerical Methodology Algorithms
This is my take on solving all algorithms in C. I will be using dynamic memory allocation to write the algorithms as C as to make the code versatile. This will also allow us to make the declare the size of our matrix in runtime.[more](https://www.geekinterview.com/question_details/3407)
